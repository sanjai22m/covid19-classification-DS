X-rays are widely used in medical practice. They can be used to identify various diseases. However, a diagnosis depends on a doctor's experience, which can lead to improper treatment. Modern methods of artificial intelligence and pattern recognition make it possible to create expert systems that allow you to establish a diagnosis automatically.

This project is dedicated to application of an advanced analysis of Big Data to the spread of COVID-19 in the world. I will study how to make image recognition of a chest X-ray to provide a diagnosis forecast.

## Objective
1. Download and transform images.
2. Create features of images.
3. Build a CNN model.
4. Build a diagnosis based on X-ray photos.

Language used: Python.

Python modules used: Pandas, Tensorflow, Keras.

Dataset used for model training: <a href="https://mega.nz/folder/CbwySSzb#D5wxALorZk93NC7kZur_6w">Covid-19 Image Dataset</a>

### Machine Learning model used: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).
### Accuracy achieved: 98%
